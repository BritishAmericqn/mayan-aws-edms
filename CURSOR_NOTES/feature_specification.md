When researchers upload CSV/Excel files, the system automatically generates statistical summaries, data quality reports, and basic visualizations.

### **Demo Scenario**
1. **Upload**: Drop a CSV file with weather station data
2. **Auto-Analysis**: System immediately processes and shows:
   - First 10 rows preview
   - Statistical summary (mean, median, std dev, quartiles)
   - Data quality report (missing values, outliers)
   - Basic charts (histograms, distributions)
3. **Insights**: Researcher immediately sees data patterns and quality issues

### **Key Value**
- **Before**: Researchers had to download files and open in Excel/Python to understand data
- **After**: Instant data insights directly in the document management system
- **Impact**: 90% faster data quality assessment and exploration

### **Demo-able Elements**
- Real-time analysis on file upload
- Interactive charts and statistics
- Data quality indicators
- Preview without downloading

## üîó **Feature 3: Secure External Sharing**
**Pre-Signed URL Generation**

### **What It Is**
Generate time-limited, secure sharing links for external collaborators without requiring Mayan accounts.

### **Demo Scenario**
1. **Selection**: Choose sensitive research document
2. **Share Generation**: Click "Generate Share Link"
3. **Configuration**: Set expiration (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week)
4. **Sharing**: Copy link and send to external collaborator
5. **Access**: Collaborator accesses document directly via secure URL
6. **Expiration**: Link automatically expires as configured

### **Key Value**
- **Before**: Email attachments or insecure file sharing services
- **After**: Secure, auditable sharing with automatic expiration
- **Impact**: Compliance-ready external collaboration

### **Demo-able Elements**
- One-click link generation
- Configurable expiration times
- Access logging and tracking
- No account required for external users

## üìà **Feature 4: Research Compliance Dashboard**
**Audit Trails + Compliance Reporting**

### **What It Is**
Enhanced audit system that tracks research-specific activities and generates compliance reports for grants and IRB requirements.

### **Demo Scenario**
1. **Activity Tracking**: Show timeline of research activities
2. **Compliance Status**: Display IRB deadline tracking
3. **Access Audits**: Show who accessed what documents when
4. **Report Generation**: Export compliance report for grant agency
5. **Notifications**: Demonstrate deadline alerts and reminders

### **Key Value**
- **Before**: Manual compliance tracking in spreadsheets
- **After**: Automated audit trails with research-specific events
- **Impact**: Streamlined grant reporting and IRB compliance

### **Demo-able Elements**
- Real-time activity timeline
- Compliance status indicators
- Automated report generation
- Grant deadline tracking

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Feature 5: AWS Cloud Integration**
**Scalable Storage + Cost Optimization**

### **What It Is**
Seamless integration with AWS S3 for document storage with intelligent lifecycle policies for cost optimization.

### **Demo Scenario**
1. **Upload**: Documents automatically stored in S3
2. **Lifecycle**: Show how older documents move to cheaper storage tiers
3. **Scaling**: Demonstrate handling large research datasets
4. **Cost Savings**: Display storage cost optimization over time
5. **Integration**: Show how pre-signed URLs work with S3

### **Key Value**
- **Before**: Local storage limitations and backup concerns
- **After**: Unlimited, cost-optimized cloud storage
- **Impact**: Scalable infrastructure with automatic cost optimization

### **Demo-able Elements**
- Transparent S3 integration
- Storage cost dashboard
- Automatic lifecycle management
- Unlimited scalability
