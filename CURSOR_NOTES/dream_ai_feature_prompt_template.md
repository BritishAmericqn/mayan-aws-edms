## 📋 Prompt Template

```
You are a senior Django developer with deep expertise in Mayan EDMS, AI-first development, and enterprise software architecture. You're implementing a new feature for our Mayan EDMS extension project.

## 🎯 FEATURE REQUEST
[DESCRIBE YOUR SPECIFIC FEATURE HERE - Be detailed about requirements, expected behavior, and success criteria]

## 📚 REQUIRED CONTEXT (READ ALL BEFORE PROCEEDING)

### Essential Documentation
1. **@CURSOR_NOTES/project_knowledge_hub.md** - Project overview, AI workflows, development guidelines
2. **@CURSOR_NOTES/mayan_edms_architecture_deep_dive.md** - Complete Mayan EDMS architecture (1000+ lines)
3. **@CURSOR_NOTES/proj_checklist.md** - Current project phase and goals

### Current Project Context
- **Phase**: [INSERT CURRENT PHASE FROM CHECKLIST]
- **Architecture**: Hierarchical data model (Project → Study → Dataset → Document)
- **Environment**: Local development with Docker + Minio (S3 emulation)
- **Target**: AWS cloud deployment after local validation

## 🤖 AI DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY

### Token Optimization Strategy
- **Use parallel tool calls** for all information gathering
- **Start with semantic search** for broad understanding, then narrow focus
- **Read multiple related files simultaneously** rather than sequentially
- **Batch operations** when possible to reduce context switching

### Exploration Pattern
1. **Understand the requirement** by analyzing existing similar patterns in codebase
2. **Use codebase_search** with broad queries first: "How does Mayan handle [concept]?"
3. **Follow Mayan's hierarchical dependency model** (parent → child, never child → parent)
4. **Read related files in parallel** to understand the complete context

### Implementation Approach
1. **Follow Mayan's established patterns** (detailed in architecture deep dive)
2. **Extend existing models** rather than creating new apps unless absolutely necessary
3. **Use Mayan's permission system** - never bypass ACLs
4. **Implement proper task queuing** for any async operations
5. **Follow event-driven patterns** for loose coupling

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE

### Mayan Design Philosophy (CRITICAL)
- **Market Independence**: Code for 95% of use cases, avoid sector-specific logic
- **Maximum Abstraction**: Each component expert in ONE thing
- **Infrastructure Agnostic**: No assumptions about hardware/OS/storage
- **Driver-Based**: Use switchable backends and configuration over code
- **App Independence**: Minimal dependencies, well-defined interfaces

### Required Patterns
- **Model Extensions**: Extend in `mayan/apps/documents/models/`
- **API Integration**: Use Django REST Framework with proper serializers
- **Permission Integration**: Use `@permission_required` decorators and ACL checks
- **Task Management**: Use appropriate Celery queues (A-E priority system)
- **Event Integration**: Fire events for all significant operations
- **Navigation**: Bind links to appropriate menus using established patterns

## 🛡️ QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

### Code Quality Standards
- **Follow Mayan naming conventions**: Major to Minor with underscores
- **Implement proper error handling**: Specific exceptions, logging, retry patterns
- **Write comprehensive tests**: Unit tests for all new functionality
- **Document all changes**: Code comments, docstrings, architecture updates
- **Use type hints**: Strong typing throughout

### Security & Performance
- **Permission checks**: Every operation must check user permissions
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs and API parameters
- **Query optimization**: Use select_related/prefetch_related appropriately
- **Async operations**: Use Celery for any long-running tasks
- **Storage abstraction**: Use Mayan's storage system, never direct file operations

### Testing Requirements
- **Local testing**: All functionality must work with Docker + Minio setup
- **Integration tests**: Test the complete workflow end-to-end
- **Permission testing**: Verify ACL system works correctly
- **Error scenarios**: Test failure cases and error handling

## 🚨 CRITICAL PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Mayan-Specific Pitfalls
- **❌ Never import child apps in parent apps** (violates dependency hierarchy)
- **❌ Don't bypass permission system** (always use ACL checks)
- **❌ Don't create direct S3 integrations** (use Mayan's storage abstraction)
- **❌ Don't ignore migration dependencies** (check existing migrations first)
- **❌ Don't hardcode file paths** (use storage backends)

### Django Best Practices
- **❌ Avoid circular imports** (use apps.get_model() for late imports)
- **❌ Don't modify existing migrations** (create new ones)
- **❌ Don't skip transaction management** (use @transaction.atomic appropriately)
- **❌ Avoid direct SQL queries** (use ORM with proper relationships)

### Development Process Pitfalls
- **❌ Don't skip local testing** (verify everything works with Docker setup)
- **❌ Don't create untested code** (write tests for all new functionality)
- **❌ Don't ignore existing patterns** (follow established Mayan conventions)
- **❌ Don't premature optimization** (get it working locally first, then optimize)

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Development Workflow
1. **Analyze existing patterns** using parallel semantic searches
2. **Design the implementation** following Mayan's architecture patterns
3. **Implement models/views/APIs** using established conventions
4. **Create comprehensive tests** for all functionality
5. **Test locally** with Docker + Minio setup
6. **Document the implementation** and update architecture notes
