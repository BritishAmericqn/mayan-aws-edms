Version 4.9.1
=============

Released: January 22, 2025


Changes
-------


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

Fixed the workflow migration 0037 for the edge case where there are existing
workflows without an initial state and without an initial transition.

Version 4.9 does not allow workflow instances without an initial state
being specified therefore these existing workflow instances are invalid.

The migration will now detect and delete these invalid workflow instances.
The migration will emit an error log in the console for each invalid
instance with the corresponding workflow template label, workflow template
ID, and document ID so users can fix and relaunch the invalid workflow
templates.

Fixed migration test case `WorkflowTemplateTransitionTriggerMigrationTestCase`
asserting `True` values instead of value equality.


Other
^^^^^

- Update the target used to build the documentation.
- Fix documentation file references.
