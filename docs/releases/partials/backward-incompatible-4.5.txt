Documents
^^^^^^^^^

Removal of the setting ``DOCUMENTS_STUB_EXPIRATION_INTERVAL``. Document
stub expiration interval is now configure on a per document type basis via
the user interface or API.

Removal of the unused signal ``signal_post_document_created``. Use Django's
default ``post_save`` signal for documents or
``signal_post_document_file_upload`` to handle new file uploads.


Task manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removal of the "Tools" queue. Each app must now define its own queue for
slow, long lived operations.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The ``WorkflowTemplateStateActionSerializer`` field ``action_path`` is
now called ``backend_path``, and the field ``action_data`` is now called
``backend_data``.

The workflow template state action template no longer has direct access to
the document to which the workflow is attached via the variable
``{{ document }}``. To access the document, do so indirectly via the
``{{ workflow_instance }}`` variable with
``{{ workflow_instance.document }}``.
