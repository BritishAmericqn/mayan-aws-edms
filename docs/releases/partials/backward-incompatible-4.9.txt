- The system will start even where the are settings with badly formatted
  values. This is the opposite of the previous behavior in which a badly
  setting would stop the start up process. Controlled with the new setting
  `SETTINGS_IGNORE_ERRORS` which defaults to `True`.
- Setting namespaces and settings now singletons. Calling the creation of
  a new setting in a namespace or a namespace in a cluster with a duplicated
  identifier will no longer raise and error, instead the previously created
  instance will be returned.
- Event types are now singletons. Calling the creation of a new event type
  with a duplicated identifier will no longer raise and error, instead the
  previously created instance will be returned.
