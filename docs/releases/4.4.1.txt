Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------


Cabinets
^^^^^^^^

The cabinet create permission is now required to create parent as well as
child cabinets. This change replaces requiring the edit permission to create
child cabinets via the HTTP views.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

A new permission was added to change the type of a document. When support for
changing the type of a document was added, it was considered a property and
controlled via the document property edit permission.

Since changing the type of a documents now causes a cascade of other
changes, it was isolated as an individual class of event along
with its own permission.

The new document change type permission is required for the document being
changed and for the document type to which the document will be changed
into.


Downloads
^^^^^^^^^

Download files are now associated to a specific users and not to a parent
object. Delete, download, and view permissions were added to allow users to
share a download file.


OCR
^^^

The OCR backend code is now executed under a new method called
``_execute`` to avoid subclasses not calling the super class.

The base backend class now prepares the image to be processed for OCR and
passes the file object to the subclass.


Search
^^^^^^

In addition to the search system refactor, new search indexes were added.
The search backend needs to be reindexed to ensure these new indexes are
populated.


Settings
^^^^^^^^

The default secret key value is now only used if the secret key file is not
found not just if the secret key file is present but unreadable.


Templating
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``home_view`` setting was removed from the default Template context.
Template instances need to include their own context using the new
``context`` argument.


Deprecations
------------

- The Cabinet API serializer field named ``parent``, will be removed in
  version 5.0. Use the ``parent_id`` instead which is functionally identical.
- The ``IndexTemplateNodeSerializer`` serializer fields ``parent`` and ``index``
  will be removed in version 5.0. Use fields ``parent_id`` and ``index_id``
  which are functionally identical.
- The ``WorkflowInstanceSerializer`` field named ``workflow_template_url``
  will be removed in version 5.0. Use the ``url`` attribute of the
  ``workflow_template`` instead.


Issues closed
-------------

- None
